                    I have been working in engineering for the last eight years, from Research Engineer in Silviculture
                    to Design Engineer in Storage Facilities, where I used Python to automate processes, and I am now
                    looking to fully transition as a Python Developer.

                    With strong ability of self taught and professional development, in the last year I studied and
                    worked to build web programs with Django and small scripts with Python and I am eager to improve my
                    Python skills in Computer Vision.
